                        Every piece of Dune Jewelry comes with a Lifetime Warranty. Each piece is handmade and made-to-order; as we like to say, “handmade with love & sandy hands”. To ensure that you enjoy your memories & experiences, and we want those memories to last a lifetime. If your Dune Jewelry isn’t what you expected (quality or comfort) we’ll gladly replace it, encouraging you to be a Dune customer for life!
